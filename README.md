Parts and Description:
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor:

The DHT11 is a commonly used Temperature and humidity sensor is sensor that I used for my assignment. The temperature and humidity readings from the sensor are output as serial data by an 8-bit microcontroller and a dedicated NTC.

Breadboard:

The breadboard I used is a thin plastic board with wired electronic components (chips, resistors, transistors, etc.) attached to it. Breadboards are reusable tools used to create electronic circuit prototypes. 



ESP32:

The ESP32 that I used is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller that has built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. It is the replacement for the ESP8266, a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with significantly less functionality.

Male to Male Wires:

The wires that I used in my assignment are male-to-male jumper wires and they are used to join any development board with a male header pin to other development boards that also have a male connector. These are straightforward cables with connector pins on both ends that enable you to link two locations together.
